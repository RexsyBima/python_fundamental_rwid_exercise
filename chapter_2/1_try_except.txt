Exercise 1: Basic Try-Except
- Write a program that asks the user to enter a number.
- Use a try block to convert the input to an integer.
- Use an except block to handle the error if the input is not a valid integer.
- Print an appropriate message in both cases.

Exercise 2: Division with Exception Handling
- Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers.
- Use a try block to divide the first number by the second.
- Use two except blocks to handle the errors if the second number is zero or if either input is not a valid number.
- Print appropriate messages for each case.

Exercise 3: Retry on Exception
- Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter a valid number until they enter one correctly.
- Use a try block to convert the input to an integer.
- Use an except block to handle the error if the input is not a valid integer and prompt the user to try agai- n.
